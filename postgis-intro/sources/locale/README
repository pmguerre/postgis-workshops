Translation files for the postgis-intro workshop

Compilation of the files require the ``pip install sphinx-intl`` python3.

To build localized refer to the README.md in root.

Using Weblate
---------------

Weblate web-ui for translation is at:
https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/postgis-workshop/

There is a web-hook `https://weblate.osgeo.org/hooks/github/` defined in https://github.com/postgis/postgis-workshops/settings/hooks that pushes changes to weblate.

Weblate does require that the pot files be kept up to date.
To do so:

```
#if using python virtual env
python3 -m venv ~/pw-env

cd postgis-intro/sources/en
make pot
#test the translations
LANG=ja make html-translation
LANG=de make html-translation
LANG=es make html-translation
LANG=it make html-translation
git add .
git commit -m "Update pots"
git push
```

The github account osgeoweblate has commit rights to this repo.
Any translations that pass approval in the weblate https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/postgis-workshop/ get pushed and automatically committed.

The postgis.net, has a cronjob that runs every 5 minutes or so checking for updates and runs this script `/var/www/postgis_workshop_update.sh` if any changes.  This builds the main english and all the translations. If new translations are added, then this script needs to be updated to build them.

Respective docs currently set to build are as follows:
